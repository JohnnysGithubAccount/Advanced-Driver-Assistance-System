# Advanced Driver Assistance System (ADAS)

## Overview

The Advanced Driver Assistance System (ADAS) is a comprehensive solution designed to enhance vehicle safety and facilitate a smoother driving experience. This project incorporates a Flask web application that provides a graphical user interface (GUI) for real-time monitoring and interaction. Key features include distance measurements, collision warning, vehicle and traffic sign detection, and lane segmentation.

- **Vehicle Detection**: Identifies vehicles on the road using advanced object detection algorithms (YOLOv8 and SORT).
- **Distance Measurements**: Quite accurate measurement of the distance between vehicles using computer vision techniques.
- **Collision Warning**: Real-time alerts to prevent potential collisions based on proximity and speed analysis.
- **Traffic Sign Detection**: Recognizes and interprets traffic signs to provide relevant warnings and information to the driver.
- **Lane Segmentation**: Analyzes lane markings for better lane-keeping assistance.
- **Flask Web App GUI**: A user-friendly interface for visualizing data and system status.
